## Overview

</div>

For my final project in ICS 314 Software Development, I worked in a group of 6 students developing a trading cards game of the ICS department faculty members. This goal aims to bridge the gap between faculty members and students by helping students get familiar with faculty faces and learn professors interests and quirks, ultimately seeing them as a human they can talk to.

Aside from the landing page, this game has 5 pages:
<li>Home Page: Users can login or create an account</li>
<li>Collection Page: Users can view the cards they own.</li>
<li>Pull for Cards Page: User can gain cards by answering quiz questions</li>
<li>Wishlist Page: Users can view all the cards in the collection and add to their wishlist</li>
<li>Marketplace Page: Users can trade their cards with other users</li>
<br>

## My Contributions

My main task throughout this project was the [Card Pull Page](https://academia-arena.xyz/pull). This page allows the user to gather points by answering ICS-related questions, and once they reach 100 points they are able to pull for a card.

Features:
<li>React Quiz Component</li>
<li>Visual Points Bar</li>
<li>Pull Button Function</li>
<li>Card Notification Pop-Up</li>
<br>

For the most part I focused on developing the Card Pull Page. Of the three main components, I struggled the most with the Pull Button Function, which once clicked randomly generates a card from the AllCards collection and adds it into the users collection.

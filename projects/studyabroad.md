## L'expérience française et être indépendant
### The French experience and being on my own.

For a month I was across the world in France on my own, immersed in a foreign culture. This was an opportunity I am very fortunate to have, as this immersion facilitated my language learning as well as honed my abilities to adapt and explore.

## Report for the Alliance Française Hawai'i 

Prior to joining the study abroad I was awarded a scholarship from the Alliance Française Hawai'i (AFH) and was also able to write a report in French to be published in their bi-monthly newsletter.

summary: "Study Abroad Experience for Summer 2023 in Annecy, France for 6 credits of language credit."
---

During the summer of 2023, I studied french in Annecy, France, a quaint small lake side town near the south of France. For a month I was across the world in France on my own, immersed in a foreign culture. This was an opportunity I am very fortunate to have, as this immersion facilitated my language learning as well as honed my abilities to adapt and explore.

There were 3 main aspects to my experience:
<li>Language Building</li>
<li>Character Building</li>
<li>Future Projections</li>

### L'expérience française et être indépendant (The French experience and being on my own.)

### Learning through people, not textbooks

I stayed with a host family, a french couple who spoke a little bit of english. They lived about 20 minutes total away from the school, 10 minute walk to the bus and a 10 minute bus ride. I shared a room with a fellow study abroad student, Terra, and had two other housemates who were also study abroad students from a different university and program. The living situation was very culturally french.




The classes were ran by the [Institut Français des Alpes (IFALPES)](https://ifalpes.com/) by French teachers. We would meet in-person in the IFALPES facility every day, alternative between mornings and afternoon classes.

I completed my course with a A2 Level Language Certificate and completed the 6 credits for my Language Requirement at UH Mānoa.

### Report for the Alliance Française Hawai'i 

Prior to joining the study abroad I was awarded a scholarship from the [Alliance Française Hawai'i (AFH)](https://afhawaii.org/) and was also able to write a report in French to be published in their bi-monthly newsletter.

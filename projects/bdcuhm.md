# Ballroom Dance Club at UH Mānoa (BDCUHM)

<p align="center" >
  
*The Ballroom Dance Club is a registered independent organization (RIO) that encourages non-dancers and beginners to join and learn how to ballroom dance. I became a member in the spring semester of 2023, and have since continued on to performing in performances and competing in competitions.*

*Currently I'm working towards the next ballroom competition in February - Aloha Ball! And after that - nationals!*

## It's all in the timing

Prior to college, my relationship with physical activity near non-existant. Enter the spring semester of my freshman year in college, where I made a radical decision to transform my attitude towards exercise. The catalyst? Joining ballroom dancing!

### The Cha-Cha-Changes

In the world of ballroom dancing, collaboration is key. As a partner sport, every dance requires open and clear communication. After a couple of performances and my first competition, I've learned effective communication with dance partners to navigating the emotional challenges that arise from the close proximity in ballroom. On top of that, my confidence has grown exponentially due ballroom. One lifestyle change I made in order to keep up with ballroom is going to the gym with a friend of mine about 3 times a week. Recognizing that ballroom is not just an art but a sport, I've become mindful of taking care of my body.

## Finding the rhythm of life

I'm currently the Communications Officer for the Ballroom Dance Club, and through that role I am facing a fresh challenge – navigating the realm of social media and promoting for our club. This endeavor introduces a learning curve, particularly for someone like me, navigating the digital landscape with limited social media experience. Still, I this challenge is exhilarating as it pushes me to broaden my skill set.

From the lessons in ballroom I've been given a set of invaluable skills that transcend the dance floor. I've learned the art of effective communication and gained confidence through each graceful movement. The personal growth attained has helped me realize that the rhythm of life often mirrors the steps taken on the dance floor, and through ballroom, I've discovered how to dance to that rhythm.

# Ballroom Dance Club at UH Mānoa (BDCUHM)
 
*The Ballroom Dance Club is a registered independent organization (RIO) that encourages non-dancers and beginners to join and learn how to ballroom dance. I became a member in the spring semester of 2023, and have since continued on to performing in performances and competing in competitions. Currently I am also the clubs Communication Officer.*

## Communication Officer Responsibilities

I'm currently the Communications Officer for the Ballroom Dance Club, and through that role I am responsible for managing the clubs' instagram account and promoting Ballroom Dance Club at various events.

My Main Responsibilities:
<li>Showcase the environment in our beginner classes</li>
<li>Highlight the opportunities to perform</li>
<li>Facilitiate open conversation within the club</li>
<br>

Being the friendly face that greets people and helps them settle into the club has been an experience that has pushes me to grow my interpersonal skills, but I've enjoyed the process.

Also given my role, it would be mindless of me to not include this.

<br>
Our next performance will be May 11, a Cha Cha, Bolero, Hustle Medley.

For competitons, I have competed in now 3 styles. Here is a list of competitions that I've competed in:

<br>
*For my Nationals experience, I competed in 3 styles - Smooth, Standard, and Rhythm, across various levels, Pre-Bronze and Bronze. My partners and I made it to the finals for almost all of our categories and placed a variety of 1st to 7th.

I've also had the opportunity to write a feature, [Just Dance](https://americandancer.org/just-dance/), for the American Dancer on my 2024 Nationals Experience. 


### General Insights: Finding the Rhythm in Life

In the world of ballroom dancing, collaboration is key. As a partner sport, every dance requires open and clear communication. After a couple of performances and my first competition, I've learned effective communication with dance partners to navigating the emotional challenges that arise from the close proximity in ballroom. On top of that, my confidence has grown exponentially due ballroom. One lifestyle change I made in order to keep up with ballroom is going to the gym with a friend of mine about 3 times a week. Recognizing that ballroom is not just an art but a sport, I've become mindful of taking care of my body. The personal growth attained has helped me realize that the rhythm of life often mirrors the steps taken on the dance floor, and through ballroom, I've discovered how to dance to that rhythm.

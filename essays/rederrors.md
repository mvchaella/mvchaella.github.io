When I was asked what my favorite color was growing up, I’d always say "the rainbow". Genuinely, I loved all the colors of the rainbow, and seeing a rainbow always made me smile. One of the things I enjoyed as I started learning how to code was how the key words would turn different colors. Whenever I declared ‘int 6’ or ‘string line’, all of a sudden it was pink and blue. I love the colors on my screen popping up as I coded. Not only does it make me happy, it makes things clear to me. Variables are one color, different parts of the method call are another, the return value is another – with color everything feels tidier. But there’s one color I’ve been seeing more often: red. 

## ESLint is a Perfectionist and I’m Not

In my last ICS class, I was introduced to the concept of coding style and its significance in programming. It was also a factor in my grade. Essentially, coding style refers to the conventions used in writing readable code, ensuring clarity and consistency throughout a program. It’s been a big topic, especially in this department, and I've participated in surveys conducted by Teaching Assistants (TAs) to determine the most effective approaches for naming variables and methods. 

Using ESLint was my intro into code analysis plugins to check to see if my code meets coding standards. When I first used it in my IntelliJ it colored everything red. It frustrated me, it was like having a nit-picky critic fixing my grammar before I even finished a sentence. From simple parenthesis placement, to spacing, to 


## Coding Style to Coding Standards

Conversely, coding standards consist of predefined rules and guidelines established by a team or organization to promote uniformity and efficiency in code development. While coding style focuses on the aesthetics and readability of code, coding standards provide a structured framework for achieving quality and maintainability in software projects.






## Red Flags to Green Lights

A good coding style is invaluable for long-term success in software development. Firstly, adhering to a consistent coding style is conducive to learning the language itself. By following established conventions and best practices, developers can better understand the underlying principles of the language, leading to improved proficiency and mastery over time. Moreover, maintaining a high-quality coding style enhances the overall quality of the codebase. Consistent formatting, clear naming conventions, and organized structure make the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. This not only improves the efficiency of individual developers but also facilitates collaboration within teams, as well as the sharing and reuse of code across projects. Additionally, a good coding style contributes to the longevity of code. Well-structured and well-documented code is less prone to errors, easier to debug, and more adaptable to future changes and updates. Consequently, investing time and effort in establishing and maintaining a good coding style pays off in the long run by ensuring the sustainability and scalability of software projects.

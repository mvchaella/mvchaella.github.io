## There are ellipses in my head (...)

I’ve always had a hard time asking questions. There’s something about them that makes forming them nearly impossible for me. Often I hear that it’s supposed to be a simple task, that I just need to let my mind string together the words, then I would have a good template to start firing off. But I’m still figuring out how to do that.

As I delve deeper into computer science it’s become evident that this is a hurdle that I need to overcome to reach my full understanding. In the realm of computer science, questions are like the glue holding everything together. It's a field where nobody's got all the answers, but everyone's got something valuable to contribute. The constant interplay of different perspectives is what keeps it vibrant. Computer science actively thrives on questions. They're not just a byproduct of the learning process – they're the driving force behind the field's growth and deepening understanding.

## A community of question marks

Stack Overflow is a prominent online community for developers to ask questions. It's a platform that allows anyone to ask a question and anyone to respond. Currently, I’m learning JavaScript for Software Development and I anticipate using Stack Overflow as a resource to clarify my understanding. People often have asked questions before that I feel like I would ask, and I benefit from the answers. 

But what makes a *smart* question? Smart questions are clear, specific, and relevant. They have contextual evidence like error messages and code snippets. They are questions that are easy to understand.

## Answering the questions? Nah, questioning the answer

Asking questions is not just about throwing words out there – it's about knowing what you're asking. The saying, "There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers" is trite, but most people forget that it’s the strength of your question that plays a huge role in steering clear of the stupid answers.

Beyond the classroom, the ability to form a smart question – to frame questions in a way that makes it as easy possible for someone to answer – is a critical skill to have in all aspects of life, especially work. It will bridge you to the people who can answer those questions with smart answers.

So whether you're questioning answers or figuring out how to question questions, the art of asking is where the real magic happens.

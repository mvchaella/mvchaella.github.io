# Project Idea: Community Swap for Move-in Week at the Dorms
Authors: Blake Watanabe, Hayden Bireley, Michaella Villanueva, Rina Ogina, Sam Doan

## Problem
During the move-in and move-out weeks of the semester, a lot of usabale appliances and other items end up going to waste. Often times when students move out and fly home it is difficult to bring item with them. Selling can be an option, but sorting out the logistics of that can be stressful as well, especially during the fast-paced move-in and move-out week.

## Solution
These items could otherwise be re-homed and given to other students moving into the dorms. It's easier and faster to hand-down items throughout campus. This app aims to make giving items away as easy as possible.

## Mockup Page Ideas
<li>Use a google map feature so that items can be sorted by location</li>
<li>A side bar that is a list of all the items</li>
<li>Each items page is sorted by category</li>

## Use case ideas

## Beyond the basics

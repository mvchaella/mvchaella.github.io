Up until now, I’ve always struggled to find a passion for anything particular. Whenever I explore I often end up falling into the same sentiment of “as long as I end up making the world a better place then no matter what I do I’ll be alright.” As flippant as that sounds it is the value I hold closest to me when thinking about the future. But “making the world a better place” isn’t really a SMART goal. It’s not specific, it’s hard to measure, too objective to be considered achievable, relevant yes, but not at all time-bound. It is a value that I hold, but as someone who now has to face entering the workforce I have to ask myself, how do I quantify making the world a better place? I found my answer in the intersection between STEM and humanities – that’s what  computer science is to me, a field where I can use technology and branch into any interdisciplinary field and quantitate the changes I make in the world.

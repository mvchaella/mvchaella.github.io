When I saw an ugly website, my first thought would be *“how could someone actually put this out there?"* With various website builders like Wix making it so easy to create visually appealing and functional sites, I figured that designing a website shouldn’t be too difficult.  But when I attempted to recreate a website with the html and css that I’ve learned, I felt humbled – it was ugly. The type of ugly you want to never put out on the web with your name attached to it. That got me thinking: *what does it take to design something that actually looks good?*

# The Basics of UI Frameworks

UI frameworks like Bootstrap and Semantic UI offer a pre-designed set of components, styles, and utilities that streamline the process of building user interfaces. At first glance, this might not seem like a big deal. After all, can't we just craft our own styles and layouts from scratch using raw HTML and CSS? Sure, but that's like reinventing the wheel every time we need to build a car.

The real allure of UI frameworks lies in their ability to save time and effort. Instead of coding out every button, form field, and navigation bar from scratch, we can simply drop in pre-made components that are already styled and responsive. This not only speeds up development but also ensures consistency across our projects. Plus, most UI frameworks come with extensive documentation and community support, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and learn best practices.

From a software engineering perspective, they promote modular and reusable code, encouraging developers to break their interfaces down into smaller, more manageable components. This not only makes our codebase more maintainable but also allows for easier collaboration among team members.

In various ways, Bootstrap makes things convenient.

Of course, UI frameworks have their limitations and drawbacks. They can sometimes be bloated, adding unnecessary overhead to our projects. And while they offer a great starting point, they can also lead to cookie-cutter designs if not customized thoughtfully. Plus, there's a learning curve involved in mastering any new framework, which can be frustrating for developers already juggling multiple languages and technologies.

# My Experience with Bootstrap 5

I have to admit, Bootstrap isn't always my favorite tool to work with. Sometimes, I struggle to find it readable. The abundance of classes and nested structures can make the HTML markup hard to follow, leading to frustration in my workflow. Additionally, its rigid conventions don't always align with the specific design needs of my projects, making me feel constrained rather than empowered. While I do appreciate the convenience Bootstrap offers, there are definitely times when I wish for a more intuitive and customizable framework that suits my coding style and project requirements better.

Here is an example of a site I attempted to create: 

<div class="row">
  <div class="col">
    <img src="https://github.com/mvchaella/mvchaella.github.io/assets/131205465/06e4cac7-1d87-417c-9a4a-42535b136679">
  </div>

  <div class="col">
    <img src=https://github.com/mvchaella/mvchaella.github.io/assets/131205465/c5920aa5-3393-4378-b42b-29bb30f3b230>
  </div>

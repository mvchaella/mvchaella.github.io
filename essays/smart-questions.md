## There are ellipses in my head (...)

I’ve always had a hard time asking questions. There’s something about them that makes forming them nearly impossible for me. Often I hear that it’s supposed to be a simple task, that I just need to let my mind string together the words, then I would have a good template to start firing off. But I’m still figuring out how to do that.

As I delve deeper into computer science it’s become evident that this is a hurdle that I need to overcome to reach my full understanding. In the realm of computer science, questions are like the glue holding everything together. It's a field where nobody's got all the answers, but everyone's got something valuable to contribute. The constant interplay of different perspectives is what keeps it vibrant. Computer science actively thrives on questions. They're not just a byproduct of the learning process – they're the driving force behind the field's growth and deepening understanding.

## A community of question marks

Stack Overflow is a prominent online community for developers to ask questions. It's a platform that allows anyone to ask a question and anyone to respond. Currently, I’m learning JavaScript for Software Development and I anticipate using Stack Overflow as a resource to clarify my understanding. People often have asked questions before that I feel like I would ask, and I benefit from the answers. 

But what makes a *smart* question? Smart questions are clear, specific, and relevant. They have contextual evidence like error messages and code snippets. They are questions that are easy to understand.

## A not-so smart question 

When writing code running into bugs is part of the process. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34373988/is-it-correct-way-of-thinking-in-my-conception) question asks, "Is it correct way of thinking in my conception?" On many occassion I've wanted to ask this exact same question, but it's been 8 years since this has been posted and there are no answers. Why?

The poster is referring to an appication in Node.js that they are writing, but they aren't clear on what the application is supposed to do, and what exactly is their goal. They've included snippets of their code, but when framing their issues they ask, "is it correct way?" 

Most glaringly, this question is subjective. Answering this would take a lot of time and effort, which means the one answering has to put in a lot more work.

## A smart question

But how do you ask for clarification on your program? [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71971688/how-to-compare-one-or-more-fields-while-iterating-in-javascript) example asks, "How to compare one or more fields while iterating in javascript?" This question is specific, and with relevant code attached to refer to.

And what is even more impressive is how the poster further explains their issues. They breakdown their post into sections, each with clippets of code to support. *What am I doing? What do I want to do? What have I done so far? and Summary.* 

And this question has been answered.

## Answering the questions? Questioning the answer!

Asking questions is not just about throwing words out there – it's about knowing what you're asking. The saying, "There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers" is trite, but most people forget that it’s the strength of your question that plays a huge role in steering clear of the stupid answers.

Beyond the classroom, the ability to form a smart question – to frame questions in a way that makes it as easy possible for someone to answer – is a critical skill to have in all aspects of life, especially work. It will bridge you to the people who can answer those questions with smart answers.

So whether you're questioning answers or figuring out how to question questions, the art of asking is where the real magic happens.
